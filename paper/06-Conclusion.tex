\section{Conclusion}~\label{sec.Conclusion}

In conclusion, the integration of multithreading algorithms marks a significant advancement in optimization beyond traditional algorithms. By harnessing the power of parallel processing, these algorithms offer fresh perspectives and avenues for optimization. Notably, the observed lower bound of time complexity, surpassing that of the original time complexity divided by the number of processors, underscores the tangible benefits in time efficiency that multithreading brings to program execution. However, this represents only the beginning of the potential unlocked by parallel algorithms. Further exploration and research are imperative to unearth even more efficient solutions and to fully realize the capabilities of parallel computing in algorithmic optimization. As technology continues to evolve, the synergy between multithreading algorithms and parallel computing architectures holds promise for pushing the boundaries of computational efficiency and problem-solving capabilities.
