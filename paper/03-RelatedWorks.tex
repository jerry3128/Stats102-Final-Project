From the basic algorithm, the most traditional algorithm is to enumerate the colors of all nodes. After that, graph-coloring problem is determined to be the NP-complete problem. Rather than solve the problem straightforward, academic circle tries to reduce the scale of the problem. Tree-decomposition is an effective method\cite{BasicTD1991} to reduce the scale of origin problem.

Then, the focus is shifted to the problems on the tree-decompositions. Improved tree-decomposition methods are found \cite{BHL1996LinearTreeDeomposition}\cite{BHL1991BetterAlgoTreeWidth}\cite{FasterTD2019} to form a more standard and solvable structures.

Next, machine learning was introduced into this problem \cite{MLonTD2017}. Machine learning is used to predict the run time of tree-decomposition structure and help problem-solver to dicide to solve which structure.
