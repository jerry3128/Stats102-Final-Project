\section{Introduction}~\label{sec.introduction}

This paper aims to use the machine learning to predict the run time of 3-colorability on a graph and its tree-decomposition. Thus we can generate multiple tree-decomposition, and find the fastest one then solve it.

This project chooses the 3-colorability as an example because it is a relatively easy NP-complete problem. This paper may first introducing some background information and give a fully view of how the project built.

This project conducts 3 parts, including data generating part, machine learning part and final test part. All 3 parts will be fully explained below analyses.

In conclusion, the paper will show the findings of optimization through machine learning on the tree-decompositions and try to explain the reasons behind such result.
