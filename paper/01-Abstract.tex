NP problems are one of the most famous problem in the theoretical computer science aspect. The exponential time complexity makes it unsolvable if the data is large. However, many methods are found to reduce the problem scale of the origin problem, including tree-decomposition. Different tree-decomposition cost different run times. However, we can fastly generate tree-decompositions \cite{BHL1996LinearTreeDeomposition}, that means, if choose the best tree-decomposition, the run time of program can be reduce a lot. Our goal is to do the further optimization based on the tree-decompositions.
